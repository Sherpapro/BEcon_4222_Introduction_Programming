= Overview

*Learning Objectives:* After completion of the course, students will be able to design and execute projects in Economics and Econometrics in a systematic and reproducible way. The course has two core objectives: to develop intermediate programming skills and to apply collaborative, reproducible code development practices. First, students will understand and apply essential programming practices in Python, including writing modular code, documenting functions and implementing error handling. They will also be able to use object oriented programming by creating their own classes to structure larger projects. Second, students will be able to collaborate on projects using Git and version control, manage shared code and work with branching and pull requests. They will know how to design relational database schemas and interact with relational data from Python. Throughout the course they will learn to produce code that is reusable, maintainable and easy to share.

== Lecture 1: The Big Picture. Set up your environment _F, A_

Lecture 1 defines the objectives of the course and motivates why programming in a shareable, reproducible way is crucial for Economists. The first part presents the course structure, the team, the examination format, and the group project expectations.

The second part (01b) introduces the tools students will use throughout the course. Students learn what a terminal is, how to navigate the file system using the command line (bash on Mac, Command Prompt on Windows), and how to work with files and paths. Students are introduced to Visual Studio Code as their IDE, and to Python as the main programming language. The lecture explains why Python projects require isolated virtual environments (unlike R's global library approach) and introduces #link("https://docs.astral.sh/uv/")[uv] as the tool for managing Python versions, packages, and project environments.

*Exercise week 1*: Students set up their course directory structure, install VS Code and extensions, install `uv`, create their first Python project with a virtual environment, and run their first Python script. They also install git for the next lecture.

== Lecture 2-3: Working Together: Version Control with Git and GitHub _A_

Lectures 2 and 3 introduce version control as a central element of collaborative data work. Lecture 2 covers the local Git workflow: repositories, commits, the staging area, branching, merging, and conflict resolution. Students learn to track changes systematically and keep their project organized. Lecture 3 extends this to remote collaboration via GitHub: connecting local repositories to a remote host, synchronizing changes, and contributing via pull requests.

*Exercise week 2*: Students practice the local Git workflow — initializing a repository, staging and committing files, creating branches, and resolving a merge conflict.

*Exercise week 3*: Students work in pairs to practice the full collaborative workflow — cloning a shared repository, working on a branch, and contributing changes via a pull request.

== Lecture 4: Intro to Python _F_

Lecture 4 provides the essential foundation for the course. This lecture will cover Python's core syntax, its fundamental data types (like strings and integers), and data structures (like lists, dictionaries, ...). We will also walk through control flow (loops and conditionals) and demonstrate how to write functions. Throughout the lecture, we will highlight the differences between R and Python (such as 0-indexing and indentation) to help students adapt their existing programming knowledge.

*Exercise week 4*: Students apply basic concepts in Python learned in the course.

#v(1em)

== Lectures 5 and 6: Python for Data: Pandas and Matplotlib _F_

This lecture introduces students to Pandas, along with some NumPy essentials. We will cover the workflow for data handling: reading data into a DataFrame, inspecting its structure, and managing missing data. Students will then learn the core tools for data manipulation, including filtering rows, grouping data, and aggregating results. The goal is to show how to perform basic (descriptive) analysis using interesting, economics-related data. Finally, we will introduce basic visualization tools, demonstrating how to generate simple plots using matplotlib to visually inspect results.

*Exercise weeks 5 and 6*: Students practice data manipulation and analysis in Python using Pandas.

#v(1em)

== Lecture 7: Introduction to Classes (OOP) _F_

This lecture introduces students to the fundamental concepts of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). We will explain how OOP is used to structure code by bundling data and functionality into reusable blueprints. Students will learn the complete process of how to define their own custom class, covering the essential components: writing the constructor, defining attributes, and creating methods. The goal is to ensure students can confidently build and use their own custom objects in Python. After covering these basics, we will explore some practical examples to showcase what can be done with a class, helping to spark ideas for the final group projects. Students will also learn how to structure a class in its own module and import it into an analysis script.

#v(1em)

== Lecture 8: Error Handling, Documentation _F_

This lecture focuses on the critical skills needed to transform a basic script into a reliable and shareable tool. We will cover the principles of Error Handling, teaching students how to anticipate common problems (like bad data inputs) and provide clear, helpful feedback to the user. The second half focuses on Documentation, explaining how to write clear descriptions for functions and classes. The goal is to ensure that the tools built in the group projects are robust, easy to use, and understandable by others.

#v(1em)

== Lecture 9: Relational Databases _A_

This lecture introduces students to relational databases and database management systems, using #link("https://duckdb.org/")[DuckDB] as the DBMS. Students learn what a database is and why it is preferable to flat files for structured data. The lecture covers the relational model: tables, relationships, primary and foreign keys, and the star schema as a design pattern. Students learn to design schemas using ER diagrams, write SQL to create tables and load data, and run basic queries. The lecture also introduces the ETL pipeline — Extract, Transform, Load — and shows how to drive DuckDB from Python.

*Exercise week 9*: Students design a star schema and write the corresponding ER diagram, implement the ETL pipeline in Python, build the database with SQL, explore foreign key constraints, and write basic SELECT queries.

#v(1em)

== Lecture 10: Querying Relational Databases _A_

This lecture builds on Lecture 9 and focuses on SQL querying. Students learn how to combine data from multiple tables using JOIN operations and understand when each type is appropriate. The lecture then covers GROUP BY and the HAVING clause. The full query order is presented. Advanced topics include Common Table Expressions (CTEs) and window functions.

= Examination

== Examination Part 1: Group Project

=== Project Overview

The goal of this project is to move beyond simple scripts and build a reusable Python tool for economic analysis. Working in groups, students will identify an economic question, source a relevant dataset, and build a Python class that automates the cleaning, analysis, and visualization of that data.

Students won't just be submitting code; they will be submitting a collaborative Git repository and two professional Quarto (`.qmd`) documents that communicate their findings and explain how their tool works.

The target audience for the project is other economists who want to use the tool. The project should be designed with reusability and shareability in mind, following best practices for code organization, documentation, and version control.

=== The Deliverables

*1. The Collaborative Repository* Students' project must be hosted on Git. We expect to see a clean commit history that reflects contributions from all group members. The repository should be organized and include a .gitignore file to keep the environment clean.

*2. The Python Class* The data analysis tool you will create is a class in a `.py` file in the repository. It should have different methods to (i) clean the data, (ii) perform some analysis /calculations (iii) visualize results.

*3. Report: The Economic Analysis* This is students' "Research Note." It should briefly explain:
- What is the topic of interest/ the 'research question'?
- What data they use?
- What are the key findings?

It should contain examples of the results / figures that students created using their class. In this report students don't have to explain the class or use all the methods, it should be an example of an interesting question that they can answer using their class.

*4. Documentation: The User Manual* This is the "Technical Guide" for other economists who want to use students' code. It must include:
- An explanation of the class
- A "Quick Start" section showing how to import students' class and run a basic analysis in three lines of code.
- For every method:
  - An explanation of what the method does
  - A description of the arguments (inputs) and return values (outputs).
  - Example Code: A few lines of code that show an example of how to use the method.
